Commented by Joe Shull
---------------------

This lesson was both fascinating and frustrating as I went through it. Without a coding background, it was difficult at first
to understand how the classifier was storing the training data, referencing it while using the Euclidean distance method, and iterating until it found the closest point for each X_test. 

As I began commenting out the classes and methods using Zed Shaw's (Learn Python The Hard Way) instructions, it became increasingly clear how the two for-loops were interacting with each other.

If anyone reads this, I hope it brings you some clarity.

Excited for the journey,
Joe
